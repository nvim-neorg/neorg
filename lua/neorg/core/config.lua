--- @alias neorg.configuration.module { config?: table }

--- @class (exact) neorg.configuration.user
--- @field hook? fun(manual: boolean, arguments?: string)    A user-defined function that is invoked whenever Neorg starts up. May be used to e.g. set custom keybindings.
--- @field lazy_loading? boolean                             Whether to defer loading the Neorg core until after the user has entered a `.norg` file.
--- @field load table<string, neorg.configuration.module>    A list of modules to load, alongside their configurations.
--- @field logger? neorg.log.configuration                   A configuration table for the logger.

--- @class (exact) neorg.configuration
--- @field arguments table<string, string>                   A list of arguments provided to the `:NeorgStart` function in the form of `key=value` pairs. Only applicable when `user_config.lazy_loading` is `true`.
--- @field manual boolean?                                   Used if Neorg was manually loaded via `:NeorgStart`. Only applicable when `user_config.lazy_loading` is `true`.
--- @field modules table<string, neorg.configuration.module> Acts as a copy of the user's configuration that may be modified at runtime.
--- @field norg_version string                               The version of the file format to be used throughout Neorg. Used internally.
--- @field os_info OperatingSystem                           The operating system that Neorg is currently running under.
--- @field pathsep "\\"|"/"                                  The operating system that Neorg is currently running under.
--- @field started boolean                                   Set to `true` when Neorg is fully initialized.
--- @field user_config neorg.configuration.user              Stores the configuration provided by the user.
--- @field version string                                    The version of Neorg that is currently active. Automatically updated by CI on every release.

--- Gets the current operating system.
