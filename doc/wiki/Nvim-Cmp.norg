* `core.integrations.nvim-cmp`

*** Integrating Neorg with `nvim-cmp`

* Overview

  This module works with the {:Completion:}[`core.completion`] module to attempt to provide
  intelligent completions. Note that integrations like this are second-class citizens and may not work in 100%
  of scenarios. If they donâ€™t then please file a bug report! 

  After setting up `core.completion` with the `engine` set to `nvim-cmp`, make sure to also set up "neorg"
  as a source in `nvim-cmp`: 

  @code lua
  sources = {
      { name = "neorg" },
  },
  @end

* Configuration

  This module provides no configuration options!
