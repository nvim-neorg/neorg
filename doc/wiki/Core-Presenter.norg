* `core.presenter`

*** Powerpoint in Neorg

    The presenter module creates slideshows out of notes or documents. 

* Overview

  The presenter module provides a special Neorg display that resembles an active slideshow
  presentation. 

  To set it up, first be sure to set the `zen_mode` variable in the {# configuration}.
  Afterwards, run `:Neorg presenter start` on any Norg file. The presenter will split up your file
  at each level 1 heading, and display each in a different slide. 

  NOTE: This module is due for a rewrite. All of its behaviour is not fully documented here as it will be
  overwritten soon anyway.
