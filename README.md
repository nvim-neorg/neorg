**:warning: Neorg `9.0.0` has introduced some breaking changes! Please see [this blog post](https://vhyrro.github.io/posts/neorg-9-0-0/) on what changed.**

## Summary

</div>

Neorg (_Neo_ - new, _org_ - organization) is a Neovim plugin designed to reimagine organization as you know it.
Grab some coffee, start writing some notes, let your editor handle the rest.

### What is Neorg?

Neorg is an all-encompassing tool based around structured note taking, project and task management, time
tracking, slideshows, writing typeset documents and much more. The premise is that all of these features are
built on top of a single base file format (`.norg`), which the user only has to learn once to gain access to
all of Neorg's functionality.

Not only does this yield a low barrier for entry for new users it also ensures that all features are integrated with each
other and speak the same underlying language. The file format is built to be expressive and easy to parse,
which also makes `.norg` files easily usable anywhere outside of Neorg itself.

A good way of thinking about Neorg is as a plaintext environment which can be adapted to a variety of use cases.
If a problem can be represented using raw text, it can be solved using Neorg.

###### :exclamation: **IMPORTANT**: Neorg is young software. We consider it stable however be prepared for occasional breaking workflow changes. Make sure to pin the version of Neorg you'd like to use and only update when you are ready.

## ðŸŒŸ Tutorial

</a>

</div>

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Neorg's setup process is slightly more complex than average, so we encourage you to be patient :)

**Neorg requires Neovim 0.10 or above to function. After you're done with the
installation process, run `:checkhealth neorg` to see if everything's
correct!**

### `rocks.nvim`

One way of installing Neorg is via [rocks.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks.nvim).

<details>
<summary>Installation snippet.</summary>

- Run `:Rocks install rocks-config.nvim` (if you don't have it already!).
- Run `:Rocks install neorg`.
- From the root of your configuration (`~/.config/nvim/` on unix-like systems), create a `lua/plugins/neorg.lua` file and place the following content inside:
  ```lua
  require("neorg").setup()
  ```

For the time being you also need `nvim-treesitter` installed, but the plugin is not readily available on luarocks yet.
To counter this, you also need to run the following:
- `:Rocks install rocks-git.nvim`
- `:Rocks install nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter`
- Just like the `neorg.lua` file, create a `lua/plugins/treesitter.lua` file and place the following content inside:
  ```lua
  require("nvim-treesitter.configs").setup({
    highlight = {
      enable = true,
    },
  })
  ```

The last three steps will eventually not be required to run Neorg.

</details>

### `neorg-kickstart`

Not bothered to set up Neovim on your own? Check out our [kickstart config](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/wiki/Kickstart)
which will get you up and running with Neorg without any prior Neovim configuration knowledge.

### `lazy.nvim`

To install Neorg via lazy, first ensure that you have `luarocks` installed on your system.
On Linux/Mac, this involves installing using your system's package manager. On Windows, consider
the [Lua for Windows](https://github.com/rjpcomputing/luaforwindows) all-in-one package.

<details>
<summary>Click for installation snippet.</summary>

```lua
{
    "nvim-neorg/neorg",
    lazy = false, -- Disable lazy loading as some `lazy.nvim` distributions set `lazy = true` by default
    version = "*", -- Pin Neorg to the latest stable release
    config = true,
}
```

</details>

While lazy [supports lazy-loading upon specific commands and
filetypes](https://lazy.folke.io/spec#spec-lazy-loading), it is known to break
things sometimes. Use at your own risk.

### `packer.nvim`

Neorg can be installed purely via luarocks on packer, pulling in all required dependencies in the process.

It is not recommended to use packer as it is now unmaintained.

<details>
<summary>Click for installation snippet.</summary>

```lua
use {
  "nvim-neorg/neorg",
  rocks = { "lua-utils.nvim", "nvim-nio", "nui.nvim", "plenary.nvim", "pathlib.nvim" },
  tag = "*", -- Pin Neorg to the latest stable release
  config = function()
      require("neorg").setup()
  end,
}
```

</details>

### Other Plugin Managers

Because of the complexities of `luarocks`, we are choosing not to support other plugin managers for the time
being. It is actively on our TODO list, however!

## ðŸ“š Further Learning

After you have installed Neorg, we recommend you head over to either the Youtube tutorial series or to the [wiki](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/wiki)!

## Credits
